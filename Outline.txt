Simulation:

look into XML parsing for input

Array of devices
Array of links
    sufficient for a graph

look into SIMPY so we have an idea how it will simulate things



Want to measure:
• Per-link buffer occupancy, packet loss, and flow rate.
• Per-flow send/receive rate and packet round-trip delay.
• Per-host send/receive rate.
as an average AND time graph





Network components:

    hosts, router, links, packets, flows

Packets have source, destination, data OR acknowledgement

Devices have name, connected links.

    Hosts have exactly 1 link to a router. 
        Records send/receive rate
        Can also receive packets and log

    Routers can have more than 1 link. 
        Have routing table computed via Bellman Ford during initialization
        Have function to forwards packets.

Link have link ID/name, link rate, link delay, link buffer, device1, device2, currently sending?. 
    Records buffer occupancy, packet loss, flow rate
    (Function to manage buffer?)
    A link may be a shared resource between flows?
    half-duplex, has a capacity

Flows have flow ID, src, dest, time to send, (current location of packet?)
    Records send/receive rate and packet RTT
    Have function that generate packets
    These are the processes will be passed into SimPy
    The run function will generate the packets, yield to other flows


Congestion control. (Managed by routers?)
    TCP Reno

    FAST-TCP
