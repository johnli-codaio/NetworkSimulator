CS143 Project/Meeting Notes

-------------------------------------------------------------------
10/9/2015
- Planning on using Python
- Use library scimpy for this.
- Check out Event Driven simulations (recreate cave story has an example)

- We will have some input, and simulation stops when all flows have been emptied out.

- Probably use Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm.
- We need to implement our own object classes.
	- Hosts, Routers, Links, Packets, Flows are the classes.

	- Packets
		Source
		Destination
		Type

	- Hosts/Routers (subclass)
		Subclass of a Device
		We need some functionality for sending

		Routing Table computation might be a bit difficult.
		(I think Cody used a special packet called Routing Packet?)

	- Link
		Needs to have a buffer zone for the packets.

	- Flow
		Most important.
		Implement Congestion Control
		People working on this should see the big picture
		Probably most code.

Git:
We should maybe have separate branches for each of the classes, so we don't mess up master branch over and over.
